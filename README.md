#alexa-lunchlady

Lunch Lady is an Alexa skill that allows you to retrieve the daily school [lunch menu](http://www.cbsd.org/Page/1593) for CBSD elementary schools. It was built using the [alexa-app](https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app) framework.

##Getting the Menu

In order to get the menu you must invoke the skill with the invocation `lunch lady`. You can request the menu for any date, relative or absolute.

For example, to get the menu for `today`, you can say:
```
Alexa, ask the lunch lady what's for lunch today.
```
